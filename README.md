# Student-Performance-Analysis
🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes student academic performance data to uncover how gender, parental education and marital status, and study hours influence math, reading, and writing scores.
🎯 Objectives

To identify demographic and behavioral factors affecting student performance.

To explore correlations between study habits and scores.

To generate actionable insights for educators.
🧩 Dataset Description

Contains 1,000+ records with attributes such as:

Gender

Ethnic Group

Parental Education Level

Test Preparation Course

Weekly Study Hours

Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
- numpy (Numerical computations)
- scipy.stats (Statistical analysis)
- sklearn (Machine learning and model evaluation)
- Statsmodels (statistical modeling and hypothesis testing):
statsmodels.api for general statistical models and analysis,
statsmodels.formula.api.ols for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression modeling, and
statsmodels.stats.multicomp for multiple comparisons testing and statistical summaries.

🔍 Methodology

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Used correlation analysis to evaluate relationships.

Visualized results in Power BI / Looker Studio.

📈 Key Insights

Males performed better in Math, females in Reading and Writing.

Higher parental education strongly correlated with better scores.

Students studying 10+ hours weekly scored significantly higher overall.

🚀 Future Improvements

Develop a regression model to predict student scores.

Expand dataset to include socioeconomic and school-related variables.
