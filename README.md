# Student-Performance-Analysis
#Project Overview

This project analyzes student academic performance data to uncover how gender, parental education and marital status, and study hours influence math, reading, and writing scores.

# Objectives

-To identify demographic and behavioral factors affecting student performance.

-To explore correlations between study habits and scores.

-To generate actionable insights for educators.

## Dataset Description
Contains 1,000+ records with attributes such as:

-Gender

-Ethnic Group

-Parental Education Level

-Test Preparation Course

-Weekly Study Hours

-Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
- numpy (Numerical computations)
- scipy.stats (Statistical analysis)
- sklearn (Machine learning and model evaluation)
- Statsmodels (statistical modeling and hypothesis testing):
statsmodels.api for general statistical models and analysis,
statsmodels.formula.api.ols for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression modeling, and
statsmodels.stats.multicomp for multiple comparisons testing and statistical summaries.

# Methodology

-Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.

-Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

-Used correlation analysis to evaluate relationships.

-Visualized results in Looker Studio.

# Key Insights
-Females achieved a higher overall pass rate than males.

-Males performed better in Math, females in Reading and Writing.

-Higher parental education strongly correlated with better scores.

-Study hours positively influence academic performance especially in maths.


# Future Improvements
-Develop a regression model to predict student scores.

-Expand dataset to include socioeconomic and school-related variables.



## üéõÔ∏è Dashboard Visualization

To complement this analysis, I built an interactive dashboard using **Google Looker Studio**.

This dashboard highlights how **gender, parental education, marital status, and study habits** influence student performance.
